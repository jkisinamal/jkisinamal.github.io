In school, he uses his talent to earn money by doing projects for other students. His market phrase is “Only a peso per page” or “drawing for a meal.”He believed that education is his ticket to overcoming the odds and being a blessing to others. A reserved individual with a strong will, wit, and an exquisite gift of talent in the arts.  The artists who mainly influenced him are; Juan Luna, Fernando Amorsolo, Michael Angelo, Leonardo Da Vinci, Frank Frazetta, and Claude Monet.

            <p>Moreover, he willingly shares his talents in Arts with anyone seeking advice to hone their gifts. He uses his artistic talent in sharing the love of God and showing them tangibly in benevolence missions. Because of his exemplary commitment to humanitarian services as an educator, missionary, and minister of God’s Word, given an Honoris Causa Doctor of Philosophy in Visual Arts Major in Classical Arts by BEST International.
