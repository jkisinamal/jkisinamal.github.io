    <br>
        <p>But nothing is an easy road because of poverty. At the very young age of 11, he tried different jobs after school and on weekends. In school, he uses his talent to earn money by doing projects for other students. His market phrase is “Only a peso per page” or “drawing for a meal.”He believed that education is his ticket to overcoming the odds and being a blessing to others. A reserved individual with a strong will, wit, and an exquisite gift of talent in the arts.  The artists who mainly influenced him are; Juan Luna, Fernando Amorsolo, Michael Angelo, Leonardo Da Vinci, Frank Frazetta, and Claude Monet. He joined many competitions in both elementary and High School.</p>
    <br>
        <p>Moreover, he willingly shares his talents in Arts with anyone seeking advice to hone their gifts. He uses his artistic talent in sharing the love of God and showing them tangibly in benevolence missions. Because of his exemplary commitment to humanitarian services as an educator, missionary, and minister of God’s Word, given an Honoris Causa Doctor of Philosophy in Visual Arts Major in Classical Arts by BEST International. A missionary, educator, minister of God’s Word, graphic designer, and visual artist. His main mediums are oil, acrylic, pencil, charcoal, and mixed media.</p>
    <br>
        <p>At present, he’s working as a freelance graphic designer for a company based in Hong Kong, specializing in packaging. With the help of family and friends, I upgraded my skill and added it to my arsenal to use the computer in doing my works of ART.</p>
